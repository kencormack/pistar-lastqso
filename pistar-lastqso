#===============
# NOTE #1: Originally written for pi-star >= 4.1.4, for DMR mode ONLY.
# Support for YSF (plus DMR2YSF and YSF2DMR) was added later.  If the
# log structure changes in any way with future releases of pi-star, or
# if you want to display modes other than DMR and YSF (D-Star, P25, etc.)
# you will need to modify this script accordingly.  I developed this
# first for DMR, using a TYT MD-UV390GPS.  I later obtained a Yaesu
# FT-70DR and added support for YSF.  If someone would like to gift me
# an ICOM ID52A or similar HT, I'd be happy to add D-Star.  Same goes
# for the other modes. ;)

# NOTE #2: I've tried to write this script with readability in mind.
# A year after having last touched a script, I like to look at it and
# quickly understand what it's doing, without a lot of head scratching.
# Comments are applied liberally, throughout, and "clever but cryptic"
# one-liners that are not immediately understandable without reading
# (and then re-reading) various man pages, are generally avoided.  The
# priority is understandability, rather than clever elegance or raw
# performance, within reason.

# NOTE #3: I cut my teeth on Sequent hardware and SVR3, 30+ years ago.
# At heart, I'm a KSH guy.  Consequently, you may find "old fashioned"
# ksh-like syntax in here (out of habbit), where a "modern"(?) bash-ism
# might exist, but that I simply forgot to use.

fnPARSE_CMDLINE()
{
  echo -e "\nenter: ${FUNCNAME[*]}" >&3

  # Loop through all the cmdline arguments.  It works like this...
  #
  # In the loop, current value would be the option we're evaluating.
  # If the option takes a parameter, we "look ahead" at the "next"
  # indexed value, and see if it makes sense to the current option.
  # An example would be the -f|--font option, and it's parameter,
  # for font selection.  Once the option, and it's parameter are
  # evaluated, we increment the index enough to skip over that
  # parameter, then loop to evaluate the next option in the array.
  #
  # If the "current" option does not expect a parmeter, we just
  # evaluate as needed, before looping to the next item in the
  # array of arguments and parameters..
  #
  # I chose this method, because both the external GNU getopt
  # command, and bash's builtin getops, have problems....
  #
  #   GNU's getopt does not handle empty flag arguments well.
  #   Bash's builtin getopts does.
  #     (Think of the "-t|--top" option to this script, which can
  #     be used either with or without specifying a history depth)
  #
  #   Bash's getopts does't parse long option names.
  #   GNU's getopt does.
  #     (Think "--help" vs "-h")
  #
  # The method I use can do both - it handles empty arguments (such as
  # the "-t|-top" option when no optional number of history lines is
  # given), and can easliy accomodate long-form options.  It is also,
  # frankly, easier to understand, and more portable, than either
  # GNU's getopt or bash's getopts.

PISTAR-LASTQSO - HELP

(Cursor Up/Down keys to scroll, Page Up/Dn to page, Q to quit help.)

  With no options, the script watches for DMR and YSF traffic.
  Log entries are parsed and presented as each log line is read.
  Use Ctrl-C to exit.

  -c|--csv
      Download an updated user.csv from radioid.net now, rather than
      waiting for the presently installed copy to age 7 days before it
      updates automatically.

  -d|--dat
      Download an updated cty.dat from country-files.com, rather than
      waiting for the presently installed copy to age 30 days before it
      updates automatically.

  -D|--DXCC
      When resolving QTH location for callsigns, pistar-lastqso first
      gambles that the callsign might also be either a DMR or NXDN
      user.  In which case, a quick check of the DMR user.csv and/or
      NXDN NXDN.csv files will find their QTH data there.

      If the callsign can't be found in those files, pistar-lastqso
      calls upon dxcc.pl to determine the country that issued the call
      sign.  This can potentially impact pistar-lastqso's ability to
      "keep up" with log entries, as each call to dxcc.pl can take up
      to 4 or 5 seconds to resolve.  When YSF traffic lasts more than
      a few seconds, this is no problem, as the script normally just
      sits there saying "QSO In Progress...".  But when the bulk of
      traffic is "[[kerchunks]]", which pistar-lastqso considers any
      traffic lasting less than 2 seconds, the kerchunks can out-pace
      the ability of dxcc.pl to keep up.  A few kerchunks here and
      there are generally not a problem.  But a large series of them
      in quick succession can cause delays.  Effectively, you will be
      listening to one callsign, but still seeing data on the screen
      for QSOs logged many seconds ago.

      This "-D|--DXCC" cmdline option can be used to disable calls
      to the dxcc.pl script, if such delays become an issue for you.

      This option has no affect on DMR traffic.  DMR and NXDN users
      go through a registration process that results in their QTH data
      being readily available in the user.csv and NXDN.csv files, thus
      calls to the dxcc.pl script are never needed for DMR traffic.

  -e|--errors
      By default, pistar-lastqso will display any error messages found
      in the MMDVM log, as they occur.  It is NOT unusual to see an
      occasional, or sporadic message, such as a queue overflow.  But
      if these or other errors are frequent or persist, you may need
      to get help from the pi-star forums.  In the meantime, you can use
      the "-e" or "--error" option to suppress the onscreen reporting
      of these errors.  The errors will however still be counted for
      the current session, and the count will still be reported on the
      exit screen.  It is your responsibility to investigate any cause.

      Use of this option DOES NOT FIX THE ERRORS coming from pi-star.
      It only stops telling you that they are happening.

      NOTE: The script also displays and tallies any WARNINGS that may
      show up in the log.  Although the -e|--error option will supress
      display of ERRORS, it will NOT supress display of WARNINGS.

  -f|--font <1-5>
      The [-f|--font] option forces use of the selected font, regardless
      of screen-width.

      Valid options are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
        1 = "small"
        2 = "standard"
        3 = "big"
        4 = "ansi_shadow"
        5 = "emulator-dependent alternate charset"

      If this option is omitted, the script will auto-select an
      appropriately sized figlet font based on the following screen-
      width thresholds:

        < 80 chars wide:  "small" font
      80-120 chars wide:  "standard" font
        >120 chars wide:  "big" font

      The "ansi_shadow" and "emulator-dependent alternate character set"
      fonts are never auto-selected.

      Font # 5 may not work for everyone.  Not all terminal emulators
      or TERM-types support the ANSI control codes for this feature.

  -h|--help
      Display this help screen, then exit.

  -i|--info
      Shows a little info in the top-right corner of the screen, when
      the following THREE CONDITIONS apply...

      A.) You MUST specify the "-i|--info" option.
      B.) Your display MUST be at least 130 chars wide.
      C.) You MUST also activate the non-scrolling information zone
          at the top of the screen using the "-t|--top" option (the
          number of lines of history, if any, is irrelevant).

      If either B or C above is false, then A is useless.  If all
      three conditions are met, a small block of information, largely
      helpful only to those looking to modify the script, is shown
      in the top-right corner of the screen.  An example looks like
      this:
                       Options & Parameters: -t 10 -f 4 -w -i -l
                   Debugging: 3>/dev/null Profiling: 4>/dev/null
            xterm Display=44x168 TTY=pts0 PID=28578 BG_PID=28887
             Modes and X-Modes: YSF=1 DMR=1 NXDN=0 DSTAR=0 P25=0
             YSF2DMR=0 YSF2NXDN=0 YSF2P25=0 DMR2YSR=0 DMR2NXDN=0
        Counts: DMR=425 YSF=214 KERCH=216 ERR=0 WARN=0 RESTART=0
            ----------------------------------------------------

      The first line shows the options and parameters passed to the
      script when launched.

      The second line lists any targets specified for the debug or
      profiling logs, as described in the ABOUT_DEBUGGING.md and
      ABOUT_PROFILING.md files.

      The third line shows TERM type, and size of the screen in rows &
      columns (useful to those who want to modify the script, as there
      is so much cursor management stuff going on).  Also shown are the
      TTY of the terminal/session the script is running on, the PID of
      the script, and the PID of the background task that watches for
      log activity (daily log rotations and pi-star nightly updates).

      The fourth line shows which of the following modes are enabled
      in pi-star: YSF, DMR, NXDN, DDTAR or P25.  If enabled, the mode
      will show a "1".  Disabled will show a "0".

      The fifth line shows which of the following cross-modes are
      enabled: YSF2DMR, YSF2NXDN, YSF2P25, DMR2YSR, and DMR2NXDN.
      If enabled, the mode will show a "1".  Disabled will show a "0".

      The sixth line shows a number of counters.  The counters repre-
      sent the following: DMR traffic, YSF traffic, Kerchunks, Errors,
      Warnings, and Restarts since program launch.  Regarding the
      restarts, expect typically two such events per day... rotation
      to a new day's log at midnight UTC, and again each night during
      pi-star's nightly update, when services are bounced.  Note too
      that any changes you make to pi-star's config via the GUI will
      also bounce the services, when your changes are saved.

      The last line shows a dashed line in normal operatation mode,
      when watching the live log.  However, when the -r|--replay
      option is specified, a simple reminder appears to indicate
      that the program is running in "replay mode".

  -l|--logo
      Disables the animated logo at startup.

  -m|--mono
      For monochrome displays, this option suppresses all color codes.

  -n|--nobig
      Disable the large font display of callsigns and ID #s.  This
      conserves vertical screen-space.

  -r|--replay /full/path/to/file
      FOR DEVELOPMENT USE: This option allows the specified file to
      be "replayed" from the start, as if it were the current log.
      This aids testing of coding changes, against problematic log
      entries, by replaying those log entries.  Troubleshooting
      another user's log too, becomes possible.  A fully qualified
      filename must be specified.

        Examples:
                -r /full/path/to/file
          --replay /full/path/to/file

        Not:
                -r filename
          --replay filename

      This also allows adding support for modes for which the user
      does not have appropriate radios, by soliciting sample logs
      from contributors who do own radios of the appropriate type.

  -t|--top [integer]
      Adds an information zone to the top of the screen that shows
      the version number of this script, date of the cty.dat and
      user.csv files, name of the active log file, TX and RX freqs,
      the hotspot's TCXO frequency and firmware version, CPU temp,
      the Modem's device node (port), the computer platform/model,
      the DMR and/or YSF Master servers, and the first 5 statically
      defined BrandMeister TalkGroups.

      By default, the use of "-t|--top" also provides a history of
      the last 5 QSOs observed.  However, by specifying an integer
      parameter, the number of QSOs displayed in the history can be
      changed.  A value of 0 (zero) disables the history (but retains
      all the other information in the "-t|--top" section of the
      screen.  Other values determine the number of lines of history
      that will be displayed.

      Examples:
        -t       defaults to 5 lines of history
        -t 0     disables the history
        -t 7     displays a history 7 lines deep
        -t 23    displays a history 23 lines deep

      CAUTION: Specifying too many lines for your actual screen-size
      will yield unpredictable (and certainly unsatisfactory) results.
      I do NOT limit-check this parameter, because SSH sessions in
      dynamically resizable windows could have a different number of
      lines each time the screen is re-sized, rendering useless any
      limit-check performed at startup.

      As a point of reference, "-t 9 --n" will maximize the size of
      the history, while still allowing full details for the QSO in
      progress (without large fonts), on a typical 80x24 display.
      Larger screens will support other combinations.  Feel free to
      experiment - YMMV.

  -v|--version
      Display this script's version number, then exit.

  -w|--wrap
      Ordinarily, if figlet decides it needs to wrap the text that it
      displays, based on the size of the font selected, and the width
      of the screen (in columns), it will do so.  However, setting
      this option tells figlet to ignore the screen width, and just
      keep printing on the same line, even if that means the text will
      disappear off the right edge of the screen.  You sacrifice what-
      ever information was off the edge of the screen, but without
      wasting so much vertical screen space to line-wrap.

  # Disabling this lookup gains you the ID numbers in the logfile, but
  # loses the Callsigns.  If I were to disable said lookups via this script,
  # pi-star web-based Dashboard users wouldn't appreciate that.  So, I work
  # backwords, taking the Callsign that MMDVMHost writes to the logs,
  # and looking up the Callsign in the DMRIds.dat file, to find the ID.

  # The problem is that in the early days of DMR, some users were registering
  # multiple IDs (one for their radio, one for each hotspot, etc.)  That
  # practice has been halted, with the prefered method of identifying
  # hotspots by adding a two-digit suffix to the user's normal 7-digit ID.
  # However, those earlier cases of multiple ID numbers mapped to the same
  # Callsign still exist in the file.  Each DMR ID links to only one Callsign,
  # but not every Callsign links to just one ID.  Some Callsigns "hit" more
  # than once in the file.  With no guarantee that I'm picking the correct ID
  # linked to a given Callsign, I just pick the first number, on the
  # assumption that that's the one that represents the user, not one of their
  # hotspot.  I wish MMDVMHost would log both Callsign and ID#.  But it's one
